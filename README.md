# cache-server-spring

A simple service written in `Java / Spring Boot` that uses `AWS DynamoDB` to cache responses from `VirusTotal`.

For authorization to VirusTotal API, there is a `.env` file which [loads the API key](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) into the app container as **VT_API_KEY** env variable.

The setup can be run via docker-compose:

```
docker-compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```
